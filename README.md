    Evlos WCS (Web Content Store)
</h1>

# Description

Web Content Store (WCS) is a system where you are able to store content to be presented by a webpage,
mobile app or even a desktop app. It doesn't care where you want the data to end up.

## Intended use

There aren't really any intended use for this more than to be a storage for content to serve to an external
app via a REST API.

## Benefits

There are a few benefits with using WCS over say WordPress.

* Simple to use and barebones web interface (No clutter, no-need functions etc)
* Cross platform (WCS doesn't care where you want the data to end up, it might be in a mobile app,
a webpage or even a desktop application)
* Lightweight
* RESTful API
* Stateless
