# WCS - Web Content Store

Web Content Store (WCS) is a system where you can store content to be presented by a webpage.
An excellent use for this is a frontend app that makes calls to the WCS RESTful API to receive
content a user has stored in WCS

## Benefits

There are a few benefits with using WCS over say WordPress.

* Simple to use web interface
* Barebones and built for the purpose of serving content to React, Angular and Vue apps.
* Cross-platform (WCS doesn't care where you want the data to end up, it might be in a mobile app,
a webpage or desktop application)
* RESTful API
* OAuth2
